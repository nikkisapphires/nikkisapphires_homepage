# Biography

I'm a trans girl born and raised in the sunshine state. I enjoy traveling, sightseeing, red wine, going to the beach, shopping for new clothes, and most importantly connecting with people. I produce my own pornography at home. You can see all my provocative content on my [OnlyFans](https://onlyfans.com/nikkisapphire) and you can check out the trailers for my videos on my [PornHub](https://www.pornhub.com/model/nikkisapphire) profile. Thank you for taking the time to check out my page. :)

# Social Outreach

Please feel free to message me on any of my social platforms (See links on the left), but I will have to apologize in advance if I do not respond. Unfortunately, my message traffic has increased since starting my social media platforms and it's difficult for me to keep up with it sometimes. Contacting me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NikkiSapphire) or [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/nikkisapphire) is usually more effective. I encourage any and all questions, just try to keep them somewhat classy.

???+ tip
    If you want to get my attention, send me memes.

# Wishlist

I periodically update my [Amazon Wishlist](https://amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/NCRLBSJ334NX) and will happily wear and post anything purchased for me. I've also added photography/videography equipment that I can use to help capture better quality content to share on my [OnlyFans](https://onlyfans.com/nikkisapphire). Of course, I added a few things that I just really, really wanted if you feel the need to spoil me.
